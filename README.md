# Project description

LETSCODE is an online coding platform just like Leetcode, hackerrank, codechef etc. which I made specifically for my college. It provides a platform for the new students(freshers) in college to start there coding journey. Also it adds a feature that faculties are able to assign their coding tests on this platform and they can also monitor the progress of students.

## Technology that I used

## Features

Features of the LETSCODE project include:

`Language Selection`: Users can choose from multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java, using a drop-down menu.

`Code Editor`: The project incorporates the CodeMirror library to provide a code editor with syntax highlighting, auto-closing brackets/tags, and line numbers for an enhanced coding experience.

`Input and Output`: Users can input data in a designated section and view the output of their code execution in real-time.

`Run Button`: A "RUN" button triggers the execution of the code, which results in the output being displayed in the output section.
